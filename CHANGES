  I hope those quotes put the world in perspective for you.  They should.

0.1.2  (Aug 16 2000)
  - applied patch by Malte John <malte@ddd.de> to fix yet another really bad
    parse bug that would output two asterisks if there was one in a string.

0.1.1  (Jan 15 2000)
  - applied patch by Kristoffer Nyberg to fix a really bad bug that would
    leave asterisks (*) in comments.

0.1.0  (Aug 15 1999)
  - added 'clean' option to Makefile
  - fixed a few major bugs by rewriting the parser in a much better way
  - added a man page that isn't very good, but it's late and I'm tired

  - Changed output so it would display a linebreak after // style quotes

0.0.7  (Feb 17 1999)

    vice versa

0.0.5  (Jan 27 1999)
  - Added "install" option to Makefile

  - Moved stuff into seperate files and commented more code
  - Cleaned up the code a lot

0.0.4
  - Fixed bug involving quotes inside of comment blocks
  - Fixed possible bug involving quotes inside of '' quotes (should never
    appear in working code, but I want to cover every possible situation)

0.0.3
  - Changed commandline so it acts as a filter and accepts filenames
  - Fixed bug involving // comments inside /**/ comments

0.0.2
  - First release
